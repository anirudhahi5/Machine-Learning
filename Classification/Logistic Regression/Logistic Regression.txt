Donâ€™t get confused by its name! 
It is a classification not a regression algorithm.
It is used to estimate discrete values( Binary values like 0/1,yes/no,true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s).
In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function.
Hence, it is also known as logit regression.
Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).

Coming to the math,the log odds ofthe outcome is modeled as a linear combination ofthe predictor variables.
odds= p/ (1-p) = probability of event occurrence / probability of not event occurrence
ln(odds) = ln(p/(1-p))
logit(p) = ln(p/(1-p)) = b0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3....+bkXk

Above, p is the probability of presence of the characteristic of interest.
It chooses parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the sample values rather than that 
minimize the sum of squared errors (like in ordinary regression).

Why log?
Since we are working here with a binomial distribution (dependent variable),we need to choose a link function
which is best suited for this distribution. And, it is logit function. In the equation mentioned above,
the parameters are chosen to maximize the likelihood of observing the sample values rather than minimizing
the sum of squared errors(like in ordinaryregression).
