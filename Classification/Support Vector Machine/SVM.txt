SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Itis a classification method. 
In this algorithm,we plot each data itemas a pointin n-dimensional space (where n is number offeaturesyou have) 
with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

For example, if we only had two features like Height andHair length of an individual,we’d first plot these two variables 
in two dimensional space where each point hastwo co-ordinates(these co-ordinates are known as Support Vectors)

Now,wewillfind some line thatsplitsthe data between the two differently classified groups of data. 
This will be the line such thatthe distancesfromthe closest point in each ofthe two groupswill be farthest away.

the line which splits the data into two differently classified groups is the black line,since the two closest points are the farthest apartfromthe line.
This line is our classifier. Then, depending on where the testing data lands on either side ofthe line,that’s what class we can classify the newdata as.

Think ofthis algorithmas playing JezzBall in n dimensionalspace.
The tweaks in the game are:
You can drawlines/planes at any angles (rather than just horizontal or vertical asin the classic game)
The objective of the game is to segregate balls of different colors in different rooms.
And the balls are not moving.
